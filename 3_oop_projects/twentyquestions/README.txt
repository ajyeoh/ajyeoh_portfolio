***************

1. Distinguishing between variations to the game.
	The distinction in the game comes after the 
	introduction sequence. User has a choice between 				
	two buttons 'Who is in your list?' and 'I've thought 	
	of someone already.' 
	
	> First option: Shows list of characters. 

	> Second option: Begins game.
	
	I did not really see the difference between the two 
	variations to the game. To me the only real 			
	difference is that at the beginning of the game, the 	
	user has a choice to view a list or not.
	
2. Learning a character - a guide/example!
	
	Notice that Gollum/Sméagol is not on this list. He is 	
	one of the most popular characters in the Tolkien
	legendarium, and you may have wanted to choose him as 	
	your chosen character. This game can learn the character.

	Let's try to add Sméagol to the list.
	
	>> Start game. 
	>> "Is the character a ring-bearer?" YES
	>> "Did the character leave Middle Earth ... ?" NO
	>> "Is the character a hobbit?" YES

	At this point the program will say, "Did you think 
	of Samwise 'Sam' Gamgee?". Answer: NO.

	Now the program will start learning. Our responses
	should be as follows:
	>> Gollum/Sméagol
	>> Did the character get killed off?
	>> Yes
		
	Then hit 'New Game' and try looking for Sméagol! =]

3. A note on the midi file
	
	Initially when I had tried to read the midi file, there was an
	error that I described in the LotrMusicPanel class. This should
	not work on a Mac -- it seems to be a problem on a Windows OS 			
	that has to do with the directory? I'm not sure.

	I've tried the program on a couple of Macs - my own laptop and 			
	on the school Macs as well. Music should play.

>>> FUN INFO ABOUT LOTR AND THIS GAME FOR THE UNINITIATED:

1: The introduction between user and program is a reference to a scene 
in the extended Lord of the Rings movie. Here is the reference: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZautQ0yhm4

2: Back-story to Sméagol: He is a ring-bearer by default, having 
carried the One Ring for so long. Although in the movies he is 
portrayed as an unidentifiable creature, Sméagol is actually a hobbit! 
He looks this way because the One Ring has extended his natural life.

Sméagol died at the end of the trilogy. He did not leave Middle Earth 
at the end of the second age. [Some characters left Middle Earth for 
the Undying Lnads/Aman/Blesed Realm. This is analogous to the idea of 
'heaven'.]

3: Alatúlië means WELCOME in Quenya, which is an Elvish dialect that 
Tolkien developed. 

Lothlórien is the forest where Galadrien lives, and the elves there 
speak Quenya.

4. J.R.R. Tolkien was primarily an academic and a philologist. In his 
spare time, he loved constructing languages, and the stories of in his 
legendarium are a byproduct/intersection of his interests.
